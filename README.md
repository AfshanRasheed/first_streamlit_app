# first_streamlit_app
My inaugural Streamlit application is geared towards enhancing the Data Analytics with Snowflake Badge 2 (DABW) course. The code is built using Streamlit and seamlessly linked to GitHub for streamlined collaboration.

The application's user interface presents a dynamic menu. It empowers users to select multiple fruits based on their preferences. The real magic happens when the chosen fruits trigger the display of relevant data sourced directly from an S3 Bucket, offering an engaging hands-on experience aligned with the core concepts of the DABW course.
